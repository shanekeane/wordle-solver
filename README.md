# wordle-solver
There are two elements here. Firstly, I have recreated the game Wordle. Secondly, I will build a model for solving this, which will be added later. 

# Description
- The wordle game uses the functions and txt files within the folder wordle. The game must be run within a folder containing this folder. 
- A demo notebook is included showing the simple method of playing the game. 
- Hard mode may be selected by inputting hard_mode=True. It is turned off by default. 
- This will later be used to create a machine learning model which will easily solve wordle puzzles.

# Packages
Works with:
- Python 3.8.10
- Termcolor 2.2.0
- Numpy 1.24.2
